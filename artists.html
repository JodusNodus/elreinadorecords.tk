		Rodrigo might be the toughest character of our little group, looking like a real badass. But don't let his appearance mislead you. Rodrigo has a very kind heart and a deep love for his family, his mother especially. His purpose in music is to honor that love true religion. His very relgious music delivers an exceptional reggeaton sound. Althoug reggeaton is mostly about women and drugs, Rodrigo really pulls off his own style. 
It's a very strong vibe that he brings to the place and we all are very influenced by his huge amount of love!</p>

				Dante is our label's darkest and yet most lyrical artist. He isn't afraid to speak on sensetive subjects and is known for being brutal in giving his opinion. Dante shows a lot of love towards the people around him and gives a lot back to the community. He publically talks about his many vices and addictions and makes sure that his audience can completally relate to him. People often refer to him as 'The Biggie of Reggaeton.' This is not just because of their related looks, but it's more about Dante's ability to speak to and move his (female) fans. Dante is El Reinado's ladykiller and top lyrical genius.

		Gents, you may think this one is for you but you couldn't be more wrong! This one, is one for the ladies! El Reinado Records proudly presents CESARA. She's the only female member of our crew, but watch out, this doesn't mean she can't handle herself.</p>
		<p>
A strong, young woman with a powerful vision and message: 
"we women are strong and we don't need anybody's judgement!"
		It leads to a reggeaton version that is one of a kind. She faces the macho world of the genre fueled by sex, money and violence and she does this in a sexy and empowering way. "Reggeaton is the music of sex and sensuality. The fact that i like to be myself and that i like to express my sensuality doesn't mean i'm an object of lust!" A bomb on sensual tunes, but you better keep your hands off! So ladies watch and learn, Pussy power activated!!!</p>
